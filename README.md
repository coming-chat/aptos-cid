## Important notes
- (1) Only users holding cid can bind address, and can bind any address. 
  If the address of owner does not want to be bound to cid, then call `clear_cid_address`.

- (2) Users can complete the transfer of cid through `aptos_token`. 
  After the transfer, the new owner of the cid should call `clear_cid_address`
  or `set_cid_address` to complete the binding with the address.

- (3) Call `unchecked_cid_resolved_address` returns the address bound to cid, 
  this return value is not timely, because `clear_cid_address` or `set_cid_address` may not be called in time.
